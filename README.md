# Gunning-fog-index
In linguistics, the Gunning fog index is a readability test for English writing. The index estimates the years of formal education a person needs to understand the text on the first reading. For instance, a fog index of 12 requires the reading level of a United States high school senior (around 18 years old). The test was developed in 1952 by Robert Gunning, an American businessman who had been involved in newspaper and textbook publishing.[1]

The fog index is commonly used to confirm that text can be read easily by the intended audience. Texts for a wide audience generally need a fog index less than 12. Texts requiring near-universal understanding generally need an index less than 8.

Calculation
The Gunning fog index is calculated with the following algorithm:

1) Select a passage (such as one or more full paragraphs) of around 100 words. Do not omit any sentences;

2) Determine the average sentence length. (Divide the number of words by the number of sentences.);

3) Count the "complex" words consisting of three or more syllables. Do not include proper nouns, familiar jargon, or compound words. Do not include common suffixes (such as -es, -ed, or -ing) as a syllable;

4) Add the average sentence length and the percentage of complex words; and

5) Multiply the result by 0.4.
